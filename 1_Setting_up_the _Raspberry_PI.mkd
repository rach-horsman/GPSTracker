# Talking to your Raspberry Pi

If you're on a mac you'll work in a terminal window. On a windows machine, you'll need to use PuTTY. 

- Open a terminal window and ssh into the RaspberryPi:

`
ssh [username]@[hostname].local
`

- You'll be asked for your password and the after a few moments you'll get confirmation that you're logged in. The initial line will change (possibly colour) to :

`
[username]@[hostname]:
`

Once logged in, you'll be able to modify the Raspberry Pi's setup, write and run programs, and navigate around the files and directories. This will all be from the terminal window using Bash commands.
