# Setting up the kit

First, attach the module with its antenna, it's a push and click but can be a little stiff.

Next, you will need to wire the module using jumper wire to your Raspberry Pi . The diagram below shows a Raspberry Pi 3 but the GPIO pins will be in the same position on the Zero, or any modern Raspberry Pi (second picture below)

Finally ,connect the power (pwr). This could be to a battery pack, mains adapter or one of your computerâ€™s USB ports (you may need an adapter). When you do this, the green light on the Raspberry Pi will start flashing (it's booting up).
After a while, the blue LED on the GPS module will also flash, this means it's receiving data from GPS satellites.
