You're going to need:
- A Raspberry Pi Zero W (and associated cables)
- A neo 6M GPS module
- A power pack such as [UPS HAT(C)](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/UPS_HAT_(C)) If you use such a power pack you will need to follow the installation guide.
- Wifi access (you'll need the network and password information)
- A laptop 
- A Google account (also lets you access Firebase and Google Map developer)
- A GitHub account
- [Visual Studio Code and the Live Server extension](https://code.visualstudio.com)

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are using Windows or a Chromebook, you will need to be able to ssh through a terminal window, this may take some preparation.
