# GPSTracker

You're going to need:
- A Raspberry Pi Zero W (and associated cables);
- A NEO-6M GPS module;
- A power pack such as [UPS HAT(C)](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/UPS_HAT_(C)). If you use such a power pack, you will need to follow the installation guide.
- Wi-Fi access (you will need the network and password information);
- A laptop; 
- A Google account (this also lets you access Firebase and Google Map developer);
- A GitHub account;
- [Visual Studio Code and the Live Server extension](https://code.visualstudio.com).

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are using Windows or a Chromebook, you will need to be able to SSH through a terminal window. This may take some preparation.
